/* Safe I2C reads
 *  i2c_read_... waits for the slave device to respond in a while loop.
 *   Should the slave address be wrong (easily detected when setting adress 
 *   pointer) or the communications be disrupted by noise or any other means,
 *   then the standard I2C read will hang indefinatly.
 *  i2c_safe_read... uses a timeout in the while loop to break out, returning
 *  I2C_SAFE_READ_ERROR_CODE instead of I2C read.
 *   This is not ideal as I2C_SAFE_READ_ERROR_CODE could be valid data, rather 
 *   if a struct with error code and data are returned, this would be more 
 *   reliable
 *  TODO: Return a struct for all I2C commands Possible call these files
