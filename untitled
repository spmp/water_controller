ADC Notes to self

PRADC, in ”Minimizing Power Consumption” on page 41 must be disabled by writ-
ing a logical zero to enable the ADC.

The analog input channel is selected by writing to the MUX bits in ADMUX

The ADC is enabled by setting the ADC Enable bit, ADEN in ADCSRA

The ADC generates a 10-bit result which is presented in the ADC Data Registers, ADCH and ADCL. By default,
the result is presented right adjusted, but can optionally be presented left adjusted by setting the ADLAR bit in
ADMUX.

ADMUX – ADC Multiplexer Selection Register
REFS1 REFS0 ADLAR – MUX3 MUX2 MUX1 MUX0

Bit 7:6 – REFS[1:0]: Reference Selection Bits
These bits select the voltage reference for the ADC
0 0 AREF, Internal Vref turned off
0 1 AVCC with external capacitor at AREF pin
1 1 Internal 1.1V Voltage Reference with external capacitor at AREF pin 
 Must use 1.1v for internal temperature sensor.
 
Bit 5 – ADLAR: ADC Left Adjust Result
The ADLAR bit affects the presentation of the ADC conversion result in the ADC Data Register. Write one to
ADLAR to left adjust the result. Otherwise, the result is right adjusted.

Bits 3:0 – MUX[3:0]: Analog Channel Selection Bits
The value of these bits selects which analog inputs are connected to the ADC

ADCSRA – ADC Control and Status Register A
ADEN ADSC ADATE ADIF ADIE ADPS2 ADPS1 ADPS0

Bit 7 – ADEN: ADC Enable
Writing this bit to one enables the ADC. By writing it to zero, the ADC is turned off. Turning the ADC off while a con-
version is in progress, will terminate this conversion

Bit 6 – ADSC: ADC Start Conversion
In Single Conversion mode, write this bit to one to start each conversion.
ADSC will read as one as long as a conversion is in progress. When the conversion is complete, it returns to zero.
Writing zero to this bit has no effect.

Bit 5 – ADATE: ADC Auto Trigger Enable
When this bit is written to one, Auto Triggering of the ADC is enabled. 

Bit 4 – ADIF: ADC Interrupt Flag
This bit is set when an ADC conversion completes and the Data Registers are updated. The ADC Conversion
Complete Interrupt is executed if the ADIE bit and the I-bit in SREG are set. ADIF is cleared by hardware when
executing the corresponding interrupt handling vector.

Bit 3 – ADIE: ADC Interrupt Enable
When this bit is written to one and the I-bit in SREG is set, the ADC Conversion Complete Interrupt is activated.

Bits 2:0 – ADPS[2:0]: ADC Prescaler Select Bits
These bits determine the division factor between the system clock frequency and the input clock to the ADC.

Bit 5:0 – ADC5D...ADC0D: ADC5...0 Digital Input Disable
When this bit is written logic one, the digital input buffer on the corresponding ADC pin is disabled.
*Note that ADC pins ADC7 and ADC6 do not have digital input buffers, and therefore do not require Digital Input
Disable bits.

ICNC1 ICES1 – WGM13 WGM12 CS12 CS11 CS10

Bit 7 – ICNC1: Input Capture Noise Canceler
Setting this bit (to one) activates the Input Capture Noise Canceler. When the noise canceler is activated, the input
from the Input Capture pin (ICP1) is filtered. The filter function requires four successive equal valued samples of
the ICP1 pin for changing its output. 

Bit 6 – ICES1: Input Capture Edge Select
This bit selects which edge on the Input Capture pin (ICP1) that is used to trigger a capture event. When the ICES1
bit is written to zero, a falling (negative) edge is used as trigger, and when the ICES1 bit is written to one, a rising
(positive) edge will trigger the capture.
When a capture is triggered according to the ICES1 setting, the counter value is copied into the Input Capture Reg-
ister (ICR1). The event will also set the Input Capture Flag (ICF1), and this can be used to cause an Input Capture
Interrupt, if this interrupt is enabled.
When the ICR1 is used as TOP value (see description of the WGM13:0 bits located in the TCCR1A and the
TCCR1B Register), the ICP1 is disconnected and consequently the Input Capture function is disabled.
